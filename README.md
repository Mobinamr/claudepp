# Claude Brainrot 🧠

> Just type `claudetiktok` and watch TikTok while Claude works!

Watch TikTok automatically while working with Claude Code! Simple command, no servers, no localhost - just TikTok opening in your browser while Claude does its thing.

## How It Works

1. Install once → run `claudetiktok` anytime
2. TikTok opens in top-right corner
3. **Claude working** → TikTok visible (watch while Claude types!)
4. **Claude waiting for your response** → TikTok docks after 3s (focus on responding!)
5. **You send new message** → TikTok undocks (watch again!)

**No login, no servers, 100% automatic**

## Installation (3 Steps Only)

### Prerequisites
- ✅ **macOS** (uses AppleScript)
- ✅ **Node.js 18+** ([Download](https://nodejs.org/))
- ✅ **Safari or Chrome**

Check Node.js:
```bash
node --version  # Should be v18.0.0+

### Step 1: Clone & Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mobinamr/claudepp.git

```

### Step 2: Link Command Globally

This makes `claudetiktok` available everywhere in your terminal!

## How It Actually Works

- **No localhost or servers** - Direct browser command via AppleScript
- **No configuration** - Just works out of the box
- **Smart docking** - Minimizes after 3s idle, restores on new activity
- **Session persistence** - Same TikTok window throughout your work

---

## Troubleshooting

### Command not found: claudetiktok
Run `npm link` again in the claudepp directory

### TikTok doesn't open
- Make sure Safari or Chrome is installed
- Check permissions: System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Automation

### Window opens off-screen
Edit window position in `bin/claudetiktok.js` line with `{900, 50, 1400, 850}`

## What Opens

- 🎵 TikTok For You page (no login needed!)
- Opens in Safari/Chrome in top-right area
- Docks automatically when waiting for your input
- Restores when you send new prompts

## Customization

Want different video site? Edit `src/video/videoPopup.js`:

```javascript
this.tiktokUrl = 'https://www.youtube.com/shorts'; // or any site!
```

## Requirements

- macOS (uses AppleScript for window control)
- Node.js 18+
- Safari or Chrome

## How It Works Technically

The app monitors HTTP activity from Claude Code:
- Detects when you send prompts → Shows TikTok
- After 3s idle → Docks TikTok to tray
- New prompt → Restores TikTok window
- Same session continues throughout!

## Privacy

- ✅ No data collection
- ✅ No tracking
- ✅ No external servers
- ✅ Everything runs locally
- ✅ No login/passwords needed
